 * It's not as convenient as javascript's "debugger;".
 *
 * For one, we have to define debugger() ourselves, and make sure to include
 * that definition when debugging our code. Also, geben stops inside debugger().
 * We actually have to step out before we see the code we're actually interested
 * in debugging. Despite those two minor issues, this is
 * nice to have.

 *   TRUE if the address is in a valid format, and FALSE if it isn't.
